## **Introduction**
This Power BI dashboard presents a detailed analysis of healthcare data to assist analysts and decision-makers in understanding patient demographics, behaviour, medical procedures, and cost patterns. The report provides actionable insights that can guide policy development, improve service delivery, and enhance patient outcomes.

##  Objective  
The primary objective of this healthcare dashboard is to analyze patient-level data and identify trends in healthcare utilization, insurance coverage, procedure types, treatment costs, and patient satisfaction. The report aims to support hospital administrators and healthcare providers in making informed decisions.

##  Core Questions  
This analysis focuses on answering the following questions:
1. What are the demographics of the patients (age, gender, region)?
2. How do lifestyle factors like smoking and alcohol use affect treatment outcomes?
3. What are the most common medical procedures and in which departments?
4. What is the average cost and duration of treatment per department or procedure?
5. How satisfied are patients post-treatment and what influences satisfaction?

##  Key Insights  
- Demographic patterns reveal age and regional clusters for specific treatments  
- Chronic conditions and lifestyle choices (smoking, alcohol) are associated with longer hospital stays  
- Certain departments like **Cardiology** and **Orthopedics** show higher treatment costs  
- Patient satisfaction trends highlight opportunities to improve service in specific regions or hospitals  

## Recommendations  
1.  Develop targeted wellness campaigns for high-risk demographics
2.  Implement data-driven cost optimization strategies for high-cost departments
3.  Monitor satisfaction metrics regularly to enhance patient experience
4.   Provide additional support for patients with chronic illnesses or risky lifestyles  

##  Conclusion  
This dashboard equips healthcare analysts with vital insights into operational performance, patient needs, and financial trends. By leveraging this data, healthcare institutions can optimize treatment delivery, increase satisfaction, and reduce inefficiencies. Future improvements could involve **machine learning-based predictions** for readmission risks or cost forecasting models.
